# NHS-Learning-Academy-Training-Performance-Dashboard
A lightweight Power BI solution that gives GOSH Learning Academy leaders a single view of who is trained, what is overdue, and where to focus next. It uses fully synthetic, non-PII data to demonstrate the end-to-end approach: data modelling, DAX measures, visuals, and operationalisation (refresh, distribution, and governance).
